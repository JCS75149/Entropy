# Maxwells_Demon
A simulation of Maxwell's Demon using pygame for graphics and pymunk for the physics of the particles.  Total energy of the particles is presevered
but velocities vary according to the physics of their collisions.  A patended Demon window opens to allow faster particles to move in one direction
and slower ones move in the opposite direction, thereby disproving Maxwell's Second Law of Thermodynamics in the thought experiment.  Particle speed is 
illustated by it's color and trailing wake.  Temperature on either side of the simulation is displayed in pixels per second.
